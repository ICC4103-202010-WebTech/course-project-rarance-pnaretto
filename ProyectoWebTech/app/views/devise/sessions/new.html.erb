      <li>Comply with existing laws</li>

      certain activities that may be damaging to the resources of both Crown
      Internet LLC and the Internet and cannot be permitted under the guise of
      free speech. The resources of EventBook LLC and the Internet are

    <p>We do not routinely monitor the activity of
      accounts except for measurements of system utilization and the
      preparation of billing records. However, in our efforts to promote good
      citizenship within the Internet community, we will respond appropriately
      if we become aware of inappropriate use of our service.</p>

      material, which EventBook LLC determines, at its sole discretion,
      to be unlawful, indecent or objectionable. For purposes of this policy,
      "material" refers to all forms of communications including narrative
      descriptions, graphics (including photographs, illustrations, images,
      drawings, logos), executable programs, video recordings, and audio

      violate the Acceptable Use Policy or our ToS, we reserve the right to
      terminate your service without notice. We prefer to advise customers of
      inappropriate behavior and any necessary corrective action, however,
      flagrant violations of the Acceptable Use Policy will result in
      immediate termination of service. Our failure to enforce this policy,
      for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of our right to
      do so at any time.</p>

    <p>As a member of our network community, you must
      use your Internet access responsibly. If you have any questions
      regarding this policy, please contact us at support@crowninternet.com</p>

    <hr>

    <h1>ToS (Terms of Service)</h1>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: *All Payments To EventBook LLC Are Non-Refundable*</strong></p>

    <p>EventBook LLC ("The Company") agrees to
      furnish services to the Subscriber, subject to the following ToS (Terms
      of Service).</p>

    <p>Use of EventBook LLC Service constitutes
      acceptance and agreement to EventBook LLC's AUP as well as Crown
      Internet LLC's ToS (Terms of Service).</p>

    <p>

      All provisions of this contract are subject to the
      ToS (Terms of Service) of EventBook LLC and AUP (Acceptable Use
      Policy). The AUP may be changed from time to time at the discretion of
      the Company. Subscriber understands that change to the AUP by the
      Company shall not be grounds for early contract termination or
      non-payment.</p>

    <p>This Agreement shall be construed in all respects
      in accordance with the laws of the state of Arizona, county of Maricopa
      applicable to contracts enforceable in that state. Venue will be
      Maricopa County, Arizona</p>

    <p>Disclosure to Law Enforcement: The AUP
      specifically prohibits the use of our service for illegal activities.
      Therefore, Subscriber agrees that the Company may disclose any and all
      subscriber information including assigned IP numbers, account history,
      account use, etc. to any law enforcement agent who makes a written
      request without further consent or notification to the Subscriber. In
      addition EventBook LLC shall have the right to terminate all
      service set forth in this Agreement.</p>

    <p>Service Rates: <br>

      Subscriber acknowledges that the nature of the
      service furnished and the initial rates and charges have been
      communicated to Subscriber. Subscriber is aware that the Company may
      prospectively change the specified rates and charges from time to time.
      The promotional offer is contingent upon Company achieving and
      maintaining its cost of service goals including but not limited to rates
      charged to company by its suppliers.</p>

    <p>Payment: <br>

      Establishment of this service is dependent upon
      receipt by the Company of payment of stated charges. Subsequent payments
      are due on the anniversary date of the year for that year's service.</p>

    <p>Payments and Fees: <br>

      Credit cards that are declined for any reason are
      subject to a $5.00 declination fee. Service will be interrupted on
      accounts that reach 10 days past due. Service interrupted for nonpayment
      is subject to a $100 reconnect charge. Accounts not paid by due date
      are subject to a $25.00 late fee. Accounts that are not collectable by
      EventBook LLC may be turned over to an outside collection agency
      for collection. If your account is turned over for collection, you agree
      to pay the company a "Processing and Collection" Fee of not less than
      $50 nor more than $150. If you desire to cancel your account, please
      follow the proper procedure to do this as outlined in this ToS.</p>

    <p>Refund and Disputes: <br>

      All payments to EventBook LLC are
      nonrefundable. This includes the one time setup fee and subsequent
      charges regardless of usage. All overcharges or billing disputes must be
      reported within 60 days of the time the dispute occurred. If you
      dispute a charge to your credit card issuer that, in EventBook
      LLC's sole discretion is a valid charge under the provisions of the ToS
      and /or AUP, you agree to pay EventBook LLC an "Administrative Fee"
      of not less than $50 and not more than $150.</p>

    <p>Failure to Pay: <br>

      The Company may temporarily deny service or
      terminate this Agreement upon the failure of Subscriber to pay charges
      when due. Such termination or denial will not relieve Subscriber of
      responsibility for the payment of all accrued charges, plus reasonable
      interest and any collection fees.</p>

    <p>Account Cancellation: <br>

      All requests for canceling accounts must be made
      in writing to support@crowninternet.com with at least 30 days notice but
      not more than 60 days prior written notice. You must have all account
      information (username/password) to successfully cancel the account.</p>

    <p>Subscriber acknowledges that the service provided
      is of such a nature that service can be interrupted for many reasons
      other than the negligence of the company and that damages resulting from
      any interruption of service are difficult to ascertain. Therefore,
      subscriber agrees that the company shall not be liable for any damages
      arising from such causes beyond the direct and exclusive control of the
      company. Subscriber further acknowledges that the company's liability
      for its own negligence may not in any event exceed an amount equivalent
      to charges payable by subscriber for services during the period damages
      occurred. In no event shall the company be liable for any special or
      consequential damages, loss or injury.</p>

    <p>New Domain Accounts: <br>

      All new webhosting accounts involving new domains
      will be set up and entered into our DNS servers within 3 to 5 business
      days. Due to unforeseen complications, however, this process may
      sometimes require up to 7 business days. If the new domain is registered
      by the account holder, there will be no handling fee. If the domain is
      registered by EventBook LLC on behalf of the account holder a
      handling fee will be incurred.</p>

    <p>Transfer of Domains: <br>

      New webhosting accounts which involve the transfer
      of a domain from another provider to EventBook LLC will require a
      minimum of seven (7) days to be set up and entered into our DNS servers.
      In some cases, such transfers may take up to sixty (60) days. Due to
      the unpredictable nature of the transfer process, no guarantees are made
      regarding the amount of time a specific transfer may take. If the
      transfer of the domain is done by EventBook LLC on behalf of the
      account holder a handling fee will be incurred. If the customer cancels
      service during the transfer period for any reason, all charges are
      considered earned.</p>

    </p><p><strong>SPAM and Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE)</strong>: <br>

    EventBook LLC takes a zero tolerance approach
    to the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) or SPAM over our
    network. Very simply this means that customers of EventBook LLC may
    not use or permit others to use our network to transact in UCE.
    Customers of EventBook LLC may not host, or permit hosting of,
    sites or information that is advertised by UCE from other networks.
    Violations of this policy carry severe penalties, including termination
    of service.</p>

    <p>Violation of EventBook LLC's SPAM policy
      will result in severe penalties. Upon notification of an alleged
      violation of our SPAM policy, EventBook LLC will initiate an
      immediate investigation (within 48 hours of notification). During the
      investigation, EventBook LLC may restrict customer access to the
      network to prevent further violations. If a customer is found to be in
      violation of our SPAM policy, EventBook LLC may, at its sole
      discretion, restrict, suspend or terminate customer's account. Further,
      EventBook LLC reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any
      costs associated with the investigation of a substantiated policy
      violation. EventBook LLC will notify law enforcement officials if
      the violation is believed to be a criminal offense.</p>

    <p>First violations of this policy will result in an
      "Administrative Fee" of $250 and your account will be reviewed for
      possible immediate termination. A second violation will result in an
      "Administrative Fee" of $500 and immediate termination of your account.
      Users who violate this policy agree that in addition to these
      "Administrative" penalties, they will pay "Research Fees" not to exceed
      $175 per hour that EventBook LLC personnel must spend to
      investigate the matter. PLEASE, DO NOT SPAM from your account.</p>

    <p>As our Customers are ultimately responsible for
      the actions of their clients over the EventBook LLC network, it is
      advisable that Customers develop a similar, or stricter, policy for
      their clients.</p>

    <p><strong>Network</strong><br>

      IP Address Ownership: <br>

      If EventBook LLC assigns Customer an Internet
      Protocol address for Customer's use, the right to use that Internet
      Protocol address shall belong only to EventBook LLC or the data
      center in which customer services reside and Customer shall have no
      right to use that Internet Protocol address except as permitted by Crown
      Internet LLC in its sole discretion in connection with the Services,
      during the term of this Agreement. EventBook LLC and its
      partnership providers shall maintain and control ownership of all
      Internet Protocol numbers and addresses that may be assigned to Customer
      by EventBook LLC and EventBook LLC reserves the right to
      change or remove any and all such Internet Protocol numbers and
      addresses, in its sole and absolute discretion. Our allocation of IP
      addresses is limited by ARIN's new policies. These new policies state
      that use of IP addresses for IP based virtual hosts will not be accepted
      as justification for new IP addresses. What this means to you is that
      you MUST use name-based hosting where possible. We will periodically
      review IP address usage, and if we find that clients are using IP
      addresses where name-based hosting could be used, we will revoke
      authorization to use those IP addresses that could be used with
      name-based hosting.</p>

    <p>Bandwidth and Disk Usage: <br>

      Customer agrees that bandwidth and disk usage
      shall not exceed the number of megabytes per month for the Services
      ordered by Customer on the Order Form (the "Agreed Usage"). Crown
      Internet LLC will monitor Customer's bandwidth and disk usage. Crown
      Internet LLC shall have the right to take corrective action if
      Customer's bandwidth or disk usage exceeds the Agreed Usage. Such
      corrective action may include the assessment of additional charges,
      disconnection or discontinuance of any and all Services, or termination
      of this Agreement, which actions may be taken is in EventBook LLC's
      sole and absolute discretion. If EventBook LLC takes any
      corrective action under this section, Customer shall not be entitled to a
      refund of any fees paid in advance prior to such action. In the event
      that a customer exceeds the included allocation, EventBook LLC may,
      at its sole discretion, collect a deposit, in an amount determined by
      EventBook LLC against customer's credit card on file with Crown
      Internet LLC. Costs for bandwidth overages are two dollars per gigabyte
      on standard and cpanel plans and four dollars per gigabyte on premium
      plans.</p>

    <p>System and Network Security: <br>

      Users are prohibited from violating or attempting
      to violate the security of the EventBook LLC Network. Violations of
      system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.
      EventBook LLC will investigate occurrences, which may involve such
      violations and may involve, and cooperate with, law enforcement
      authorities in prosecuting Users who are involved in such violations.
      These violations include, without limitation:</p>

    <p>Accessing data not intended for such User or logging into a server or account, which such User is not authorized to access.</p>

    <p>Attempting to probe, scan or test the
      vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or
      authentication measures without proper authorization.</p>

    <p>Attempting to interfere with service to any user,
      host or network, including, without limitation, via means of
      overloading, "flooding", "mail bombing" or "crashing".</p>

    <p>Forging any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any e-mail or newsgroup posting.</p>

    <p>Taking any action in order to obtain services to which such User is not entitled.</p>

    <p><strong>Notification of Violation:</strong></p>

    <p>EventBook LLC is under no duty to look at
      each customer's or user's activities to determine if a violation of the
      AUP has occurred, nor do we assume any responsibility through our AUP to
      monitor or police Internet-related activities.</p>

    <p>First violation: Any User, which EventBook
      LLC determines to have violated any element of this Acceptable Use
      Policy, shall receive an email, warning them of the violation. The
      service may be subject at EventBook LLC's discretion to a temporary
      suspension pending a User's agreement in writing, to refrain from any
      further violations.</p>

    <p>Second Violation: <br>

      Users that EventBook LLC determines to have
      committed a second violation of any element of this Acceptable Use
      Policy shall be subject to immediate suspension or termination of
      service without further notice.</p>

    <p>We reserve the right, to drop the section of IP
      space involved in Spam or Denial-of-Service complaints if it is clear
      that the offending activity is causing great harm to parties on the
      Internet. In particular, if open relays are on your network or a
      customer's network, or if denial of service attacks are originating from
      your network. In certain rare cases, we may have to do this before
      attempting to contact you. If we do this, we will contact you as soon as
      is feasible.</p>

    <p>Suspension of Service or Cancellation: <br>

      EventBook LLC reserves the right to suspend
      network access to any customer if in the judgment of the EventBook
      LLC network administrators the customer's server is the source or target
      of the violation of any of the other terms of the AUP or for any other
      reason which EventBook LLC chooses. If inappropriate activity is
      detected, all accounts of the Customer in question will be deactivated
      until an investigation is complete. Prior notification to the Customer
      is not assured. In extreme cases, law enforcement will be contacted
      regarding the activity. The customer will not be credited for the time
      the customer's machines were suspended.</p>

    <p>EventBook LLC reserves the right to amend
      its policies at any time. All Sub-Networks, resellers and managed
      servers of EventBook LLC must adhere to the above policies. Failure
      to follow any term or condition will be grounds for immediate
      Cancellation. You will be held responsible for the actions of your
      clients in the matter described on these Terms and conditions.
      Therefore, it is in your best interest to implement a similar or
      stricter Terms and conditions or otherwise called Acceptable Terms of
      use policy.</p>

      emphasize that in agreeing to the EventBook LLC Acceptable Use
      Policy (AUP) and Terms of Service (ToS), customer indemnifies Crown
      Internet LLC for any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and
      Terms of Service (ToS) that results in loss to EventBook LLC or the
      bringing of any claim against EventBook LLC by any third-party.
      This means that if EventBook LLC is sued because of a customer's or
      a customer of a customer's activity, the customer will pay any damages
      awarded against EventBook LLC plus all costs and attorney's fees.</p>
