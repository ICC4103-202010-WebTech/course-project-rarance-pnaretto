### `Project delivery 4 Pedro Naretto and Roberto Arance`
`Before running is important to run the following commands (we didnt use the populate fake data, we like the oldschool style):`

`rake db:drop` `rake db:migrate` `rake db:seed`

IMPORTANT

`To do the crud opreations is needed to acces to "ADMIN" and then click on the button of system management`

`Due to active storage functioning we could not add images on the seed, to actually show that it works it must be uploaded by the user manually`

`We hope that you enjoy our page!`
